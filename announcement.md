Grab a cup of your favourite brew, and watch our welcome message on the Canvas homepage. Browser online for a copy of the textbook, check out the LMS, pack your bag, and get ready for our return to campus!

Given the somewhat unusual circumstances we find ourselves in, we plan to be flexible and adapt our lecture delivery mode as needed in the first few weeks of semester.

{:.lead.text-center.mt-5.mb-3}
You'll note that you have two key contacts: Dr. Cohney and Dr. Qi.

{:.lead}
We ask that you copy us both onto queries where reasonable, so that we can provide you with the fastest response time to any queries, noting that both of us are able to help with almost all issues. 

### Planning Survey
To help us plan we sincerely ask that you fill out a survey about delivery modes and class activities at [https://melbourneuni.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8pQojMO5lfiZsHQ](https://melbourneuni.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8pQojMO5lfiZsHQ)

The survey includes a few extra questions about activities you would like to help meet more classmates and have fun, as well as an option to be matched with a study group. While the study groups are student directed, we hope that this can be one extra opportunity for things to go right.

### Lectures

We have three lectures a week.

We will start off on campus, in person, with a live-stream available. We are also are exploring ways to bring in online participants, live, while lecture is happening. All teaching activities will be recorded.

We are also planning on a few experiments to make the subject *even more* engaging, for those who are able to attend live. This includes the use of props and hands-on participation.

### Workshops

Workshops will start from Week 2 and be run in a mixed model of both on campus and online (via Canvas Zoom page). Workshop recordings will be released by Friday each week from Week 2 in Canvas Lecture Capture page.

### Consultations
Starting from Week 1, Dr. Jianzhong Qi will run an online consultation session at 3PM-4PM on Tuesdays. You can also attend in person at Melbourne Connect, 700 Swanston St, Level 3, 3325. This session will not be recorded.

Dr. Cohney will also host office hours Tuesday 2:15PM-3:00PM, Melbourne Connect, 700 Swanston St., Superfloor (M) with private and zoom consultations available by appointment.
