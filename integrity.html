<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>All University of Melbourne students are expected to uphold academic integrity&nbsp;<u>in all aspects of every piece
        of work that they submit for assessment</u>. &nbsp;This page has some guidelines and links to resources to help
    you learn about and demonstrate academic integrity.</p>
<p>While there is a lot of detail below, the fundamental issue you have to confront is whether you&nbsp;value&nbsp;the
    University's position on academic integrity and whether you are willing to&nbsp;uphold this value in
    every&nbsp;piece&nbsp;of work you do. &nbsp;If you align your values to "learning with integrity", implementation of
    the following is easy and becomes second nature. &nbsp;If you don't&nbsp;value&nbsp;academic integrity, you can
    still implement the mechanics of the requirements below, but at some stage you may &ldquo;forget&rdquo;, or take
    some&nbsp;short cuts&nbsp;in your assessment, which will probably turn out badly for you either while as a student,
    or as a&nbsp;professional&nbsp;after graduation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Resources</h4>
<p>Start by becoming familiar with the University of Melbourne Academic Integrity website.&nbsp;<span><a
            href="http://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/">Unimelb Academic Integrity</a></span>&nbsp;(opens in new
    window).</p>
<p>Be sure to make clear which ideas are yours and which ideas are from other sources.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you
    submit work, your assessor needs to be able to discriminate between what is&nbsp;<u>your original work</u>, what
    is&nbsp;<u>your interpretation of the work of others</u>, and what is&nbsp;<u>completely other authors' work</u>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presenting only what is other peoples&rsquo; work, even if correctly attributed, is unlikely to achieve a good mark.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use a recognised referencing system to acknowledge other sources in written text such as essays and paragraphs
        written in response to questions.&nbsp;<a href="http://library.unimelb.edu.au/recite">Referencing Systems</a>
    </li>
    <li>Use the referencing system as above for images and drawings in assessment submissions.</li>
    <li>Most images and drawings in publications are subject to copyright and you may need to get the permission of the
        copyright holder to use it. &nbsp;See this&nbsp;<a
            href="http://copyright.unimelb.edu.au/information/copyright-and-research/students-introduction-to-copyright">student
            introduction to copyright</a><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Even if images are
            &ldquo;public&rdquo;, for example, available on the internet, you should provide the URL from which they
            were sourced.</span></li>
    <li>For computer programs, any sections of code copied from other sources must be clearly delineated and referenced
        in comments. &nbsp;Your final code should include:</li>
</ul>
<p>(<span>a</span>)<span>&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span>&nbsp;</span>detailed comment stating which part of it, if
    any, is copied, stating who originally wrote the copied part, how it was accessed (for example, by providing a URL),
    all included in a comment at the start of the program or in a header file;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;clear comments in the body of the program marking the start and end of all sections of copied material. Give
    the name of the original author in the comments;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;if code has been obtained from elsewhere, then modified by the student, the modifications must be explained
    in a prominent component of the submission. For example, a comment might have the wording &ldquo;The original code
    obtained from John Smith was modified to print more detailed error messages&rdquo;. Each adaptation of the original
    code must be documented, both in a prominent location and in each part of the code that was modified;</p>
<p>(d) code should never be solicited or commissioned from any source, including classmates, past students, and
    pay-for-service tutors and on-line sources.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For spreadsheets, use text boxes or comments to clearly differentiate between your work and that of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All students should learn how to read Turn It In feedback reports available in the&nbsp;<span><a
            href="https://lms.unimelb.edu.au/support/index-of-guides#students">LMS user guides</a></span>.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Our expectations</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The University of Melbourne expects that all students, but especially for Master&rsquo;s students, will study
        all the above resources and ensure that they adopt these best-practice approaches.</li>
    <li>For individual assignments, you are expected to learn first, then communicate what you have learnt as you work
        on your assignment. &nbsp;This means you may discuss the topics in question with other students while you are
        learning, but you must write all of your assignment yourself. &nbsp;This includes:</li>
    <li>Choosing which<span>&nbsp;</span><span>resources</span><span>&nbsp;</span>you decide to reference;</li>
    <li>Creating the overall structure of your communication and argument; and</li>
    <li>Preparing your own figures, calculations and analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For team<span>&nbsp;</span><span>assignments</span><span>&nbsp;</span>the University of Melbourne expects you to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>discuss and decide as a team how you are going to complete the assignment, and document this agreement via
        meeting minutes that include the names of people who attended each meeting, what periods they were present for,
        and what the agreed assignment of duties was;</li>
    <li>learn first (perhaps an aspect allocated by your group);</li>
    <li>teach others in your team what you have learnt;</li>
    <li>collaboratively decide how to communicate your learning and who will write what, and again document that via
        meeting minutes that are circulated to all group members shortly after the end of the meeting;</li>
    <li>check the work of your team mates before submission, using plagiarism checkers if possible;</li>
    <li>inform your subject coordinator on submission if you have concerns about a team member&rsquo;s contribution</li>
    <li>acknowledge that the assignment upholds the principles of academic integrity by way of an assignment coversheet
        or as part of the electronic submission process (e.g. LMS
        or<span>&nbsp;</span><span>TurnItIn</span><span>&nbsp;</span>declaration); and</li>
    <li>use a plagiarism checking service before final submission (where provided).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that not (or&nbsp;minimally) contributing to a team assignment, but still putting your name on the submission
    and claiming credit for it is another form of academic misconduct. Group members concerned about the imbalance of
    contributions to the group project should raise the issue with the subject coordinator as soon as the behaviour in
    question is noted, and again (preferably via formal work-share statements) again when the project is submitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Common ways that students fail to show academic integrity.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Copying and pasting material from the internet without using quotation marks and/or without providing a
        reference/URL and proper acknowledgement. &nbsp;This usually results from poor research practice. &nbsp;Use
        the&nbsp;<a href="http://services.unimelb.edu.au/academicskills">Academic Skills</a>&nbsp;service and&nbsp;<a
            href="http://services.unimelb.edu.au/academicskills/all_resources#research-referencing">these
            resources</a>&nbsp;to improve.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Incorrectly paraphrasing by simply swapping some words for synonyms, but leaving the structure of a sentence the
        same.</li>
    <li>Failing to acknowledge the source of figures and/or images.</li>
    <li>Copying the text, analysis, calculations, and/or program code of another student</li>
    <li>Copying from the lecture and or assignment notes of your subject, or from the textbook or other similar
        resources used in the subject. These are the intellectual property of your lecturer or other authors and should
        be acknowledged just like any other piece of writing. &nbsp;You must paraphrase these to demonstrate you
        understand the ideas you are learning, or using quotation marks where you have copied material exactly. &nbsp;If
        you are copying assignment instructions make sure to distinguish these, for example by using a different font
        style.</li>
    <li>Explicitly giving your work to another student, or in any way allowing you work to be &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; by
        another student, even if by carelessness (for example, by allowing them to have access to a memory stick on
        which you have a copy of your program or work, even though you didn&rsquo;t tell them the program was on it).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In connection with the last of these points, note that allowing other students to see your assessment work,
    &ldquo;just so that I can take a look and get some ideas, I won&rsquo;t copy, honest&rdquo;, is also inappropriate.
    If another student asks to see your work then they
    have<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>already</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>violated the friendship that you have with them,
    and your best answer is a firm &ldquo;<strong>no</strong>&rdquo;. Any other response is a breach of academic
    integrity on your part as well as their part, and is likely to irrevocably damage your friendship with that person.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can avoid these mistakes through careful note taking practices and being sure to acknowledge all ideas that are
    not your own. &nbsp;To learn more about referencing and academic integrity, join the Academic Integrity Module
    and/or the Library Research Skills for Engineering in the &ldquo;Communities&rdquo; area on your LMS home page.</p>

<h4>Penalties for not following the principles of academic integrity</h4>
<p>The process for<span><a
            href="http://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/plagiarism-investigation-and-penalties">&nbsp;investigating
            plagiarism and possible penalties are outlined here.</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Academic Board has also published&nbsp;<span><a
            href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/governance/structure/committees/academic-board/appeals/academic-and-general-misconduct-appeals">guidelines
            for common forms of breaches of academic integrity</a></span>. &nbsp;Scroll down to the lower half of this
    page to the section "PENALTIES FOR ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT - INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example of the many types of penalties from the above document.</p>
<p><em>Cheating &ndash; copying from or providing to another student or students an answer or answers to any assessment
        task or essay:</em></p>
<ul>
    <li><em>First year undergraduate student - failure of subject - Mark 0, Grade N;</em></li>
    <li><strong><em>Any other student</em></strong><em>, second or subsequent offence -&nbsp;<u>suspension or
                termination of enrolment - Mark 0, Grade N;</u></em></li>
    <li><em>Second or subsequent offence - termination of enrolment - Mark 0, Grade N.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means, if you are a Masters student,&nbsp;<u>even if it is your first semester of study</u>, if you cheat and
    get caught you will probably fail the subject. &nbsp;This may cost you</p>
<ul>
    <li>an extra semester of study; and/or</li>
    <li>an extra semester of living costs while you remain a student; and/or</li>
    <li>the need to get a visa extension (if applicable), and/or</li>
    <li>additional tuition fees to re-enrol in the subject.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
