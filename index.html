    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
    <p>In many projects, it is important for programmers to have fine control over low-level details of program
        execution,
        and to be able to assess the cost of a design decision on likely overall program performance. This subject
        introduces students to a system programming language that gives programmers this kind of control, explores a
        range
        of standard data structures and algorithmic techniques, and shows how to apply them to frequently encountered
        problems.</p>
    <p><strong>Learning materials</strong></p>
    <p>The subject&nbsp;is divided into 12 weeks. The lecture slides and workshop tasks&nbsp;will be made available to
        you
        in Canvas each week prior to the classes. To see the components and materials of this subject, go to <a

    <p><strong>Assessments</strong></p>
    <p>There will be a mid-semester test in Week 5 (tentative) worth 10% of your final mark. Details of the mid-semester
        test will be made available closer to the date of the test. To help you prepare, a sample test will also be
        provided.<br /><br />There will also be regular project work, to be completed during (and then after) the
        workshops,
        including two assessed programming projects that account in total for 30% of your final grade.<br /><br />The
        written two-hour examination at the end of semester is worth 60% of your overall mark. The exam will require
        detailed knowledge of the workshop exercises and projects, so it is important that you understand all of the
        programming work. A sample exam paper will be made available closer to the date of the exam.<br /><br />Note:
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are hurdle requirements on both assignment work and the
            exam/mid-semester test.</span>
