    Currently a Master of Computer Science student at Unimelb with interests in Machine Learning and Programming Languages.  
    4th semester tutoring Foundations of Algorithms.  
    I enjoy meeting new students and seeing what gets them ticking (hopefully, C & Algorithms!).  
    Also studying Chinese, but I'm not very good at it.

    Hey there! I'm Alec and I am in my final year of my Computing and Software Systems undergrad here at Unimelb. This will be my fourth semester working alongside Jianzhong as a tutor, and my second semester teaching this subject. Tutoring at university has been one of the most fulfilling and rewarding experiences in my life. The moment where a student finally understands a difficult concept is a feeling that keeps me motivated to tutor.
