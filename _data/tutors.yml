    Hey there! I'm Alec and I am in my final year of my Computing and Software Systems undergrad here at Unimelb. This will be my fourth semester working alongside Jianzhong as a tutor, and my second semester teaching this subject. Tutoring at university has been one of the most fulfilling and rewarding experiences in my life. The moment where a student finally understands a difficult concept is a feeling that keeps me motivated to tutor.

    I'm super passionate about both computing and teaching! I've been tutoring at UniMelb since 2015, and among other research roles, have been a designer/developer of the Quantum User Interface (QUI) [project](https://qui.research.unimelb.edu.au/).
    I completed my MSc (Computer Science) in 2020. 
    My [thesis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3385956.3418957) focused on the utility of Virtual Reality in Quantum Computing education.
    Outside of work I'm into health and fitness, travel, and am somewhat of a rollercoaster fanatic!
  fact: "I love rollercoasters so much I once travelled through Ohio USA specifically to visit a renowned theme park called Cedar Point! (And if you're wondering, it was well worth the detour!)"
