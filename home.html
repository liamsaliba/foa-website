                    <p>The first day of teaching for this subject is March 1, 2022 and classes will be
                        commencing as
                        scheduled. The first lecture will be delivered in person, live-streamed, and available
                        subsequently as a recording.
                    <p>Teaching will be delivered both in-person (for some workshops, consultations, and lectures), and
                        online. The exact modes of lecture delivery will be determined early in semester, on the basis
                        of student feedback and feasibility.

                    <p>Arrangements may change following the directions of the University's COVID response team,
                        and

            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>In many projects, it is important for programmers to have fine control over low-level details of program
                execution, and to be able to assess the cost of a design decision on likely overall program performance.
                This subject introduces students to a system programming language that gives programmers this kind of
                control, explores a range of standard data structures and algorithmic techniques, and shows how to apply
                them to frequently encountered problems.</p>
            <h5>Learning Materials</h5>
            <p>The subject&nbsp;is divided into 12 weeks. The lecture slides and workshop tasks&nbsp;will be made
                available
                to you in Canvas each week prior to the classes. To see the components and materials of this subject, go

            <h5>Assessments</h5>
            <p>There will be a mid-semester test in Week 5 (tentative) worth 10% of your final mark. Details of the
                mid-semester test will be made available closer to the date of the test. To help you prepare, a sample
                test
                will also be provided.</p>
            <p>There will also be regular project work, to be completed during (and
                then
                after) the workshops, including two assessed programming projects that account in total for 30% of your
                final grade.</p>
            <p>The written two-hour examination at the end of semester is worth 60% of your
                overall
                mark. The exam will require detailed knowledge of the workshop exercises and projects, so it is
                important
                that you understand all of the programming work. A sample exam paper will be made available closer to
                the
                date of the exam.</p>
            <p>Note: There are hurdle requirements on both assignment work and the
                exam/mid-semester test.</p>
